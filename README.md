Rebar is a minimal statusbar for herbstluftwm (and others, but it can only display your workspace status if you are on herbstluftwm) that uses an asynchronous runtime to update its three widgets.

# Dependencies
Currently, rebar relies on dzen2 to render the statusbar. At some point this will be changed to use an all-rust renderer.
